**Lending institutions face the challenge of predicting whether a borrower will repay a loan or default on it. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can assist in this - prediction process. The model uses historical data on loan applicants to learn patterns and make predictions on new loan applications.**

## Data
The data used for training and testing the model can be found in the data directory. The dataset includes various features such as income, credit score, loan amount, and more. Ensure that the data is preprocessed before training the model.

## Model
The predictive model is implemented using scikit-learn and Pandas. The main script for training and evaluating the model is loan_repayment_prediction.py.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

pandas==1.3.3
scikit-learn==0.24.2
seaborn==0.11.2
matplotlib==3.4.3
